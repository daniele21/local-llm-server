**Korgis** is the product and browser control-plane identity. **Local LLM Server** remains the repository, package and CLI identity.

## Why Korgis exists

I'm exploring [how much AI can move from the cloud to infrastructure and devices we control](https://daniele21.github.io/), and where Local, Hybrid or Cloud actually makes sense.

Korgis tackles the runtime side of that question:

> **Can local models become reliable infrastructure for real applications?**

Running one model is easy. Real applications are harder. They may need several specialist models, predictable memory use, safe lifecycle handling, scheduling, observability and reproducible execution.

Korgis puts those concerns behind one local control plane.

## What you can do today

You can:

- run GGUF and MLX models through supported local backends;
- keep multiple runtimes resident behind one HTTP server;
- use text, vision-language and transcription capabilities when the selected runtime supports them;
- load, inspect, pin and unload runtimes from the browser control plane;
- enforce explicit resource budgets and bounded request admission;
- inspect runtime identity, resource state, scheduler state and diagnostics;
- run reproducible evaluations and compare compatible evidence;
- call text generation through an OpenAI-compatible API.

Korgis does not replace inference engines such as `llama.cpp` or MLX. It manages the lifecycle, policy, resources and evidence around them.

## How to use it

### 1. Install the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniele21/local-llm-server.git
cd local-llm-server

python3 -m pip install 'uv==0.8.13'
uv sync --frozen --extra dev
```

### 2. Download and start a model

```bash
uv run --frozen local-llm models
uv run --frozen local-llm download nemotron-nano-4b

uv run --frozen local-llm serve \
  --model nemotron-nano-4b \
  --enable-admin-api \
  --no-download
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1235/
```

Useful local surfaces:

| Surface | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Korgis | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/` |
| API examples | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/example` |
| Swagger | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/docs` |
| Health | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/health` |
| Runtime identity | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/runtime/identity` |
| Runtime status | `http://127.0.0.1:1235/status` |

### 3. Use the product

A simple first loop is:

1. open **Overview** and check that the server is healthy;
2. inspect the model under **Models & Runtimes**;
3. send a prompt from **Playground**;
4. inspect runtime/resource evidence under **System / Diagnostics**;
5. run an evaluation if you want comparable evidence.

### 4. Call it from an application

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1",
    api_key="local",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="nemotron-nano-4b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Extract the action items."}],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

`api_key="local"` only satisfies SDK construction. The normal loopback API does not currently require authentication.

To use your own GGUF, multiple models or other backends, see [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) and [`docs/configuration-reference.md`](docs/configuration-reference.md).

## How it works

```text
Application / Korgis
        |
        v
Local HTTP API
        |
        v
Capability + policy boundary
        |
        v
Scheduler + runtime manager
        |
        v
Resident model + resource lease
        |
        v
llama.cpp / MLX / specialist backend
        |
        v
Normalized output + evidence
```

A few concepts stay deliberately separate:

```text
artifact != configured model != resident runtime != default route
```

That makes lifecycle and resource ownership explicit instead of hiding them behind a single “model loaded” state.

Korgis also keeps evidence honest: measured, estimated, configured and unavailable values are not collapsed into the same claim.

## Security defaults

The default boundary is local and conservative:

- loopback bind on `127.0.0.1`;
- CORS disabled unless configured;
- admin APIs disabled unless explicitly enabled;
- no silent cloud fallback;
- remote media and remote model/tokenizer code require explicit trust;
- public execution identity does not expose private paths, prompts or outputs.

The server does not currently provide authentication. Do not expose administrative routes to an untrusted network.

## Current status and limits

Korgis is an active local AI runtime control plane with accepted deterministic software validation and representative Apple Silicon evidence for the tested scope.

Current limits still matter:

- support claims are tied to tested models, backends, hardware and procedures;
- automatic pressure-triggered eviction remains disabled;
- post-stop memory deltas are observations, not a general reclamation or production-safety guarantee;
- new hardware, performance, cancellation, thermal or cross-device claims need matching representative evidence.

See [`docs/current-state.md`](docs/current-state.md) for the exact current state.
