# HTTP API reference

Document type: operational-reference
Owner: public API
Canonical scope: operations.http-api
Read when: integrating an application, evaluator, or operational tool with Local LLM Server
Last reviewed: 2026-08-15

This document explains the supported HTTP surfaces and their operational semantics. Swagger at `/docs` remains the executable schema for the checked-out revision; this guide owns the cross-endpoint meaning, compatibility expectations and usage patterns that are difficult to express in generated API docs.

## Base URL and security model

The default local root is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1235
```

The OpenAI-compatible namespace is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1
```

The default bind is loopback and the server does not currently provide built-in authentication. Binding to `0.0.0.0` or another non-loopback interface exposes public routes to the network; place that deployment behind an explicit trusted network/authentication boundary.

Administrative routes are disabled unless the server is launched with `--enable-admin-api`.

## Public runtime endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | server/runtime readiness |
| `GET` | `/status` | mutable runtime activity/phase evidence |
| `GET` | `/v1/runtime/identity` | stable, versioned, path-free execution identity |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | OpenAI-compatible resident model discovery |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible chat completion and SSE streaming |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | first-class multipart audio-to-text for explicit ASR runtimes |
| `GET` | `/` | Local LLM Studio |
| `GET` | `/example` | copy-ready integration examples |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Swagger UI for the active revision |

## `GET /health`

Use this for a basic process/product-stack readiness check before attempting inference. A successful health response means the HTTP stack is responding; it does not imply that a particular requested model is resident or that every backend is ready for every task.

For model-specific readiness, combine health with `/v1/models` and, when relevant, `/v1/runtime/identity`.

## `GET /v1/models`

The endpoint follows the OpenAI model-list shape and exposes resident models. A minimal client should rely on `data[].id` for model discovery.

Representative shape:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
      "object": "model"
    }
  ]
}
```

Local LLM Server may enrich model entries with server-owned metadata such as registry key, backend, creation state or default-route status. Generic OpenAI clients should not require provider-specific enrichments.

A configured/downloaded model is not automatically resident, and a resident model is not automatically the default route.

## `POST /v1/chat/completions`

### Minimal request

```json
{
  "model": "nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Reply with OK."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0
}
```

If the request names a model, Local LLM Server either routes to that model or fails explicitly. It does not silently substitute a different local or remote model.

### Canonical non-streaming response

Consumers should primarily rely on standard OpenAI-compatible fields:

```json
{
  "model": "nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "OK"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 8,
    "completion_tokens": 1
  }
}
```

`usage` and backend timing evidence are emitted only when the underlying runtime can supply trustworthy values. Missing metrics remain missing; they are not reconstructed from unrelated counters.

The server may include provider-specific convenience/evidence fields in addition to the OpenAI-compatible response. Integrations that require reproducible semantics should explicitly document any such field they consume instead of treating all extras as stable API.

### Streaming

Set:

```json
{
  "stream": true,
  "stream_options": {"include_usage": true}
}
```

The response uses Server-Sent Events with `data:` frames and an OpenAI-compatible delta structure. Terminal usage/timing information may arrive after content frames. A buffered completed response is never labelled as true incremental streaming.

## `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`

This endpoint is a first-class transcription task, not a chat prompt convention.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F "model=my-asr-runtime" \
  -F "file=@meeting.wav"
```

The selected runtime must explicitly declare transcription capability. Merely accepting audio as a modality is not sufficient. Task-specific evidence such as backend wall-clock duration, audio duration, realtime factor and segment count remains distinct from generation token/TTFT metrics.

## `GET /v1/runtime/identity`

This endpoint answers: **what exact resident execution configuration would produce an inference result?**

Protocol:

```text
local-llm-identity-v1
```

It can expose model ID/revision/hash/quantization, backend/version, safe effective runtime configuration + digest and bounded hardware identity. It deliberately excludes private paths, URLs, credentials, prompt/output content, hostname and dynamic request counters.

Read [`runtime-identity-api.md`](runtime-identity-api.md) for the complete JSON schema and evidence rules.

## `GET /status`

This endpoint answers: **what is the serving runtime doing now?**

Representative selected-runtime fields include:

```json
{
  "model": "nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
  "backend": "llama_cpp",
  "state": "ready",
  "active_requests": 1,
  "max_concurrent_requests": 1,
  "phase": "generating",
  "output_chunks": 12,
  "output_characters": 640,
  "chunks_per_second": 18.4
}
```

The multi-runtime response may place these objects under `models[model_key]` and expose `default_model` at the top level.

`chunks_per_second` is chunk evidence, not token throughput. See [`runtime-status-reference.md`](runtime-status-reference.md).

## Administrative control-plane endpoints

These routes exist only when `--enable-admin-api` is active.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/models/registry` | configured catalog and capabilities |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/models/load` | load another runtime |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/models/activate` | load/select the default runtime |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/models/{model}` | unload an idle runtime |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/resources` | resource budget and accounting evidence |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/evidence` | privacy-safe runtime/task evidence |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/scheduler` | queue/admission evidence |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/policies` | effective policy evidence |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/residency` | pin/eviction eligibility state |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/residency/pin` | pin or unpin a runtime |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/residency/eviction/preview` | deterministic LRU/TTL candidate preview |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/residency/evict` | explicit administrative eviction attempt |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/v1/evaluation/...` | test sets, runs, history and comparisons |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/logs/stream` | live logs over SSE |

Use Swagger for the exact request/response body of each administrative operation on the checked-out revision. The important policy boundary is stable: administrative mutation is opt-in, evidence surfaces must remain privacy-safe, and missing resource values are not fabricated as zero.

## Failure semantics

Supported product entrypoints validate task/media/capability policy before backend execution when the information is available. Clients should expect explicit HTTP failure for invalid input, unavailable routing/capability, disabled policy or backend failure rather than silent fallback.

Do not build automation by matching free-form backend exception strings. Prefer HTTP status, bounded public error fields where supplied, and explicit capability/identity/status surfaces.

## Which endpoint should an integration use?

Use this decision rule:

```text
Need to generate/transcribe?        -> /v1/* inference endpoint
Need to know what is resident?      -> /v1/models
Need reproducible execution ID?     -> /v1/runtime/identity
Need mutable live runtime activity? -> /status
Need resource/policy/admin state?   -> /api/v1/* with admin enabled
Need exact current schema?          -> /docs
```

For AI Performance Lab specifically, inference, identity and status are three independent contracts; none should be inferred from another.
