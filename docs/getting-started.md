Read when: installing Local LLM Server, starting a first runtime, or verifying a working local deployment
Last reviewed: 2026-08-15

This guide is the shortest path from a clean checkout to a verified local inference endpoint. It focuses on the supported product stack rather than the legacy module-level compatibility app.

## 1. Prerequisites

Local LLM Server requires Python 3.10+ and macOS or Linux. Some backends have additional platform requirements:

- `llama_cpp`: GGUF through `llama-cpp-python`;
- `mlx`: Apple Silicon text inference through MLX;
- `llama_server`: managed `llama-server` subprocess, including supported GGUF multimodal workloads;
- `mlx_vlm_server`: Apple Silicon vision-language serving;
- transcription requires an explicitly transcription-capable runtime plus the audio extra when local preprocessing helpers are needed.

Install the package from the repository:

```bash
pip install .
```

For development or backend-specific extras:

```bash
pip install ".[dev]"
pip install ".[mlx]"
pip install ".[vision]"
pip install ".[audio]"
```

A development checkout that needs all current extras can use:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,mlx,vision,audio]"
```

## 2. Inspect the model registry

List configured models before starting the server:

```bash
local-llm models
```

The command shows the registry key, resolved model ID, approximate size when known, backend, tags, local-download state and the configured default model.

Download a registry model without starting the server:

```bash
local-llm download nemotron-nano-4b-q8
```

To guarantee that serving never triggers a download, add `--no-download` when starting the server.

## 3. Start one model

A minimal supported launch is:

```bash
local-llm serve --model nemotron-nano-4b-q8
```

To expose the administrative control-plane APIs and the complete Studio workflows:

```bash
local-llm serve \
  --model nemotron-nano-4b-q8 \
  --enable-admin-api
```

Defaults are intentionally local:

```text
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1235
```

After startup, the main surfaces are:

```text
Studio       http://127.0.0.1:1235/
Swagger      http://127.0.0.1:1235/docs
Health       http://127.0.0.1:1235/health
Models       http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/models
Identity     http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/runtime/identity
Status       http://127.0.0.1:1235/status
```

## 4. Verify the serving stack

Check the server first:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/health
```

Then inspect the resident model list:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/models
```

Inspect stable execution identity:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/runtime/identity
```

Inspect dynamic runtime state:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/status
```

These last two endpoints intentionally answer different questions:

- `/v1/runtime/identity` describes the model/runtime/configuration/hardware identity that an evaluator can freeze before a run;
- `/status` describes mutable activity such as active requests, current phase and observed chunk rate.

See [`runtime-identity-api.md`](runtime-identity-api.md) and [`runtime-status-reference.md`](runtime-status-reference.md).

## 5. Send a chat completion

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Reply with the single word OK."}
    ],
    "temperature": 0
  }'
```

The public text API is OpenAI-compatible. Application code may therefore use the OpenAI Python SDK with the local base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1", api_key="local")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="nemotron-nano-4b-q8",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this meeting."}],
    temperature=0,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

`api_key="local"` satisfies SDK construction; Local LLM Server does not currently authenticate the normal loopback API.

## 6. Start multiple resident runtimes

```bash
local-llm serve \
  --models nemotron-nano-4b-q8 qwen3-vl-4b \
  --default-model nemotron-nano-4b-q8 \
  --enable-admin-api
```

A configured artifact, a resident runtime and the default route are distinct states. A server may also be healthy with zero resident runtimes.

## 7. Use transcription

When an explicitly transcription-capable runtime is resident:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F "model=my-asr-runtime" \
  -F "file=@meeting.wav"
```

Audio modality alone does not imply transcription support. Unsupported task/capability combinations are rejected before backend execution on supported product entrypoints.

## 8. Connect AI Performance Lab

For the richest Performance Lab run, Local LLM Server provides three independent surfaces:

```text
/v1/models + /v1/chat/completions  -> inference
/v1/runtime/identity               -> frozen execution identity
/status                            -> sampled dynamic telemetry
```

Performance Lab does not need an internal Python dependency on this repository. See the Performance Lab operational guide and this repository's [`runtime-identity-api.md`](runtime-identity-api.md).

## 9. Before treating the setup as verified

A useful local readiness check is:

1. `local-llm models` shows the intended registry entry;
2. the intended model is resident in `/v1/models`;
3. a deterministic chat request succeeds;
4. `/v1/runtime/identity` identifies the intended runtime, while unknown evidence remains explicitly `null`/partial;
5. `/status` changes during inference without being confused with stable identity;
6. no unexpected remote media/code behavior has been enabled;
7. if the server is bound beyond loopback, the deployment has an explicit trusted network/authentication boundary.

If any step fails, use [`troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md).
